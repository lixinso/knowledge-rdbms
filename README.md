# CAP Theorem

- Consistancy

Every read receives the most recent write or error.

- Availability

Every request receives a (non-error) response, without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write.

- Partition Tolerance

The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes.
